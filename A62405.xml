            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>From the Commiſsioners of Scotland, 24 February, 1640.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S our Declarations and Remonſtrances before our comming into <hi>England,</hi> were neceſſary for manifeſting the Truth againſt the Lyes, and Calumnies of our Enemies, ſo did Wee conceive, that afterward they ſhould not be needfull. Our deportments, and carriage in this great cauſe, which are no other in ſecret, then they are openly, being reall demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the conſtant integrity of our Intentions, and proceedings, in all our ways.</p>
            <p>Malice, notwithſtanding, is ſo impudent, and indefatigable, that although She hath printed on Her face the black characters of many groſſe lyes, which are viſible to all, and cannot be waſhed of, and although by the force of Truth, the Daughter of Time, Shee hath received many wounds and daſhes, which ſhall never be cured, yet dare She open her mouth again, and wearieth not to keepe Her owne ſtraine, but in a contrary courſe: for now beginneth She to ſuggeſt, that after We have in a good part obtained our own ends: We have leſſened our care of our Neighbours, And that our love towards them is become luke-warm, that We are become remiſſe in our zeal againſt Prelacie, the cauſe of all our broyls, and in the purſuit of theſe two firebrands, which had waſted all, if God in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not prevented ſo great a miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>We marvell not at Malice, nor do We deſire to be reconciled to her, for that were to loſe our ſelves, and the Cauſe of God, And therefore We think it not ſtrange that ſhee is the ſame, which ſhee hath beene, and muſt be to the end: But that by her ſuggeſtions, and practices, tending, by raiſing of jealouſies and ſuſpitions, to divide the two Kingdomes, the two Houſes of Parliament, and either Houſe in it ſelfe, ſhee ſhould ſo far prevaile with any, who have not laid aſide both wiſdome and charity, as that the ſmalleſt jealouſie or ſuſpition of us ſhould enter in their heart (for them to live and lodge, we will not permit.) This is it which hath cauſed this Paper.</p>
            <p>What juſt cauſe of indignation We had againſt theſe two Incendiaries is known by our Accuſations, which (as Wee underſtand) are now publiſhed to the World, and by theſe alſo, beſide our deteſtation expreſſed in all our Words, Writs, and Actions; Our judgment and intentions concerning Epiſcopacy both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> are in ſome meaſure expreſſed. Wee confeſſe it were levity, to be found building that which Wee have beene pulling downe, or to plant that which Wee have been plucking up. It were impiety to ſpare much more to plead for guilty <hi>Agag,</hi> and curſed <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> which God in his juſtice hath deſtinate to deſtruction: And it were folly for us, and a denying of our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to imagine that both they, and the Kingdomes can have peace; but all theſe three imputations might be juſtly tripled upon us, if now after We have ſeen their works, and bitter fruits in <hi>England,</hi> Wee ſhould not remember the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime never to be forgotten, <hi>The ſafety of the People is the ſoveraigne Law,</hi> and that <hi>Mercy to the bad is cruelty againſt the good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, We deſire that your Lordſhips would be pleaſed to repreſent ſo much from us to the Parliament, and with all, that for the preſent, according to the Commiſſion given to us, Wee doe long to ſee Iuſtice done upon the Lievtenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> earneſtly craving according to the famous and laudable cuſtome of that grave and honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, He may beare the puniſhment, which the atrocity of his Crimes doe deſerve, Which ſhould be much for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties honour, and for the peace of all his Majeſties good Subjects, who will be out of hope of the redreſſe of their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, if the wicked, who have cauſed all their woes, be either juſtified, or ſpared. Better that One periſh then Vnity.</p>
